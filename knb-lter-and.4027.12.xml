    <abstract>
      <para>Since 1987, we have been monitoring populations of West Slope cutthroat trout (Onchorhyncus clarki clarki) in two standard reaches of Mack Creek in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest.  Beginning in 1993, we included monitoring of Pacific Giant Salamanders, Dicamptodon tenebrosus.  The two standard reaches are in a section of clearcut forest (ca. 1963) and an upstream 500 year old coniferous forest. Sub-reaches are sampled with 2-pass electrofishing, and all captured vertebrates are measured and weighed. This study constitutes one of the longest continuous records of salmonid populations on record.</para>

      <para>Field notebooks stored in 262 Nash Hall, OSU.</para>
      <para>Earlier data from these same reaches, dating to 1975 are also available from other sources (see publications, below).  However, these data are not continuous and used different sampling methodologies, and consequently are not presented in this dataset. In 1994, a road culvert between the clearcut and old-growth reaches was removed, along with much of the road fill used to support it.  The culvert was replaced by a bridge.  The gaging station is located less than 20 meters below the downstream end of the culvert, and was also redesigned to handle higher discharges.  The flume for the gage was modified to include a small fish ladder, thereby increasing the possibility for upstream movement of cutthroat trout. Additional information from each sample year is presented below.</para>
      <para>
1987 - Unittype and Unitnum corrected according to later determinations. No fins clipped. ONCL lengths are total lengths; all individuals weighed. No DITE sampled. </para>
      <para>
1988 - Sampled by reach, not unit. No fins clipped. ONCL lengths are total lengths; all individuals weighed. No DITE sampled.</para>
      <para>
1989 - Sampled by reach, not unit; same reaches as 1988. No second pass M reach, CC section due to darkness.  No fins clipped. ONCL lengths are total lengths; all individuals weighed. No DITE sampled.</para>
      <para>
1990 - Sampled by channel unit, but same reaches as previous years. No fins clipped. ONCL lengths are total lengths; all individuals weighed. No DITE sampled.</para>
      <para>
1991 - Sampled by channel unit, but same reaches as previous years. First year of fin clips:  all fish in old-growth given left ventral (LV) clip, those in clearcut given right ventral (RV) clip. Scale samples taken for some individuals. ONCL lengths are total lengths; all individuals weighed. No DITE sampled.</para>
      <para>
1992 - Sampled by channel unit, but same reaches as previous years. Clip field refers to fish marked in previous year and recaptured. Fin clips continue with same procedure as previous year. Log jam between C 9 and R 11 given designation S 10. Unit formerly P 10; filled in; now a rapid. ONCL lengths are total lengths; all individuals weighed. No DITE sampled.</para>
      <para>
1993 - Sampled by channel unit, but same reaches as previous years. Clip field refers to fish marked in previous year and recaptured. Fin clips continue with same procedure as previous year. ONCL lengths are total lengths; weights for 50 fry per section only. DITE sampled for first time; mostly snout-vent (LENGTH1) data taken, with some snout-tail (LENGTH2); 50 individuals weighed from each section.</para>
      <para>
1994 - Sampled by channel unit, but same reaches as previous years. Clip field refers to fish marked in previous year and recaptured. Fin clips continue with same procedure as previous year. ONCL lengths are total lengths; weights for first 50 fry per section only. All DITE have snout-vent data (LENGTH1); snout- tail measurements (LENGTH2); 50 and weights only from first 50 individuals in each section.</para>
      <para>
1995 - Sampled by channel unit, but same reaches as previous years. Clip field refers to fish marked in previous year and recaptured. Fin clips continue with same procedure as previous year. ONCL lengths are fork lengths (first year). Weights only for sub-sample of both ONCL and DITE in both sections.</para>
      <para>
1996 - Sampled by channel unit, but same reaches as previous years. Upper reach in clearcut section shocked in separate halves (note different dates). In old-growth, added a lower pool in Lower reach; Middle reach much longer due to increase in side channel by Devil's Club Creek. One hundred meter section above Lava Falls (150 m above old growth reach) sampled this year only; these fish given adipose (AD) fin clip. Clip field refers to fish marked in previous year and recaptured. Fin clips continue with same procedure as previous year. ONCL lengths are fork lengths.</para>

          <para>Field Methods Methods - AS006</para>
          <para>The 150 m reaches are each divided into 3 contiguous 50 m reaches, which are each blocked off with nets.  Each 50 m sub-reach is then sampled with two-pass electrofishing.  All vertebrates captured are measured and weighed (note:  lengths only since 1999).  Since 1991, all cutthroat trout are also given fin clips to monitor movement between the reaches.</para>

          <description>
            <para>Mid-elevation, third-order stream.  Gradient of 8%- 15%.  Lower 150 m is in portion clearcut in 1963, with stream gage and flume 100 m upstream of the top of the sampled section.  Upper 150 m is in 500 year-old old-growth stand dominated by Tsuga heterophylla (TSHE), Psuedotsuga menziesii (PSME), and Thuja plicata (THPL).  Study encompasses a riparian reference stand (TV010), monumented channel cross-sections (GS002), stream discharge (HF004), water chemistry (CF002), meteorology (MS001), and long-term study of in-channel wood (GS006).</para>

          <para>The same 150 m reaches of stream (clearcut and old- growth) are monitored annually.  In addition to performing the population measurements on the aquatic vertebrates, a standard set of channel measurements (channel type, wetted widths and depths) are taken.</para>

      <abstract>
        <para>The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics.</para>
        <para>Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. </para>
        <para>The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources.</para>

          <descriptorValue>The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms.</descriptorValue>
